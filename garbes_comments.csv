	- chk_b2 = the number of times the hh head has been set. 1 - correct

	- err_g1_5a (G1) = 
	- chk_g1_6 (G1) = check sum of percentage of area planted with crops within plots. 1 - correct, 2 - fishy. Takes f4a(Fallow) and f14a(Trees) into account ( 1 - if percentages add up to 100 and no fallowing and no trees or percentages < 95 and some fallowing and some trees, 2 - otherwise)
	- chk_g1_5a = 1 if sum of areas planted with crop equal(or less for parcels left fallowing or with trees) the parcel area, 2 otherwise

*** TODOs
	- make sure there's only one head selected - done
	- gps collection E18 after livestock
	- not assume the area units are the same in G1 as in E, pull from csv
*** Questions
	- is section B2 asked only for the members three months or more
	- what's the minimum age persons can be parents (aux_female, aux_male)
	- only interested in the parents of the measured children?
	- what are valud values for E3a, E6a?
	- valid ranges for F14, F13a, F7a
	- can I force crop area units to parcel area units
